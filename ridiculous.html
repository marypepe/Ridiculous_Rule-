  <h1>Most Ridiculous Rule</h1>
  <p> Hannah was here </p>
<p>My five cousins and I were walking around the mall together around 6:30 at night. We were walking to the food court having a good time and ordered Chinese food. After we finished our meal, we got up to go to Forever 21. </p>
<h2> Cop Comes Up to Us </h2>
<p> All of a sudden, a cop approached us and told us we had to split up. We asked why, and he said that no more than 3 people could walk together around the mall due to safety reasons. We found this to be ridiculous and did not obey his orders. </p>
